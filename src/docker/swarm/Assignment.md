## Create Multi-Service app
1. Use docker's distributed voting app.
2. Use `swarm-app-1` directory in our course repo for requirements.
3. 1 volume, 2 networks, and 5 services needed.
4. Create the commands needed, spin up services, and test app.
5. Everything is using Docker Hub images, so no data needed on Swarm.
