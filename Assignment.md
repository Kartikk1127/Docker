1. docs.docker.com and --help are your friend.
2. Run a nginx, a mysql and a httpd (apache) server
3. Run all of them in detached mode and with name.
4. nginx should listen on 80:80, httpd on 8080:80, mysql 3306:3306
5. When running mysql, use the --env or -e to pass the MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes
6. Use docker container logs on mysql to find the random password it created on startup.
7. Clean it all up with docker container stop and docker container rm (both can accept multiple names or ID's).
8. Use docker container ls to ensure everything is correct before and after cleanup.


### Answers
1. Apache : ```docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name httpd httpd```
2. Mysql : ```docker run -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root --name mysql mysql```
3. Nginx : ```docker run -d -p 80:80 --name nginx nginx```


## Assignment 2
1. Dockerfiles are part process workflow and part art.
2. Take existing Node.js app and dockerize it.
3. Make dockerfile. Build it. Test it. Push it. Rm it. Run it.
4. Expect this to be iterative.
5. Details in dockerfile-assignment-1/Dockerfile.
6. Use the alpine version of the official 'node' 6.x image.
7. Expected result is website at http://localhost
8. Tag and push to your docker hub account.
9. Remove your image from local cache, run again from hub.


## Assignment 3
1. Database upgrade with containers.
2. Create a postgres container with named volume psql-data using version 9.6.1
3. Use Docker hub to learn VOLUME path and versions needed to run it.
4. Check logs, stop container
5. Create a new postgres container with same named volume using 9.6.2
6. Check logs to validate.
7. Note: This only works with patch versions, most SQL DB's require manual commands to upgrade DB's to major/minor versions, i/e/ it's a DB limitation not a container one.

### Answers
1. ```docker volume create pgdata```
2. ```docker container run -d --name postgres -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust -v pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:15.1```
3. ```docker container run -d --name postgres2 -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust -v pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:15.2```


## Assignment 4
1. Use a Jekyll "Static Site Generator" to start a local web server.
2. Don't have to be web developer: this is example of bridging the gap between local file access and apps running in containers.
3. source code is in the course repo under bindmount-sample-1
4. We edit files with editor on our host files and updates web server
5. start container with ```docker run -p 80:4000 -v $(pwd):/site bretfisher/jekyll-serve```
6. Refresh our browser to see changes.
7. Change the file in _posts\ and refresh browser to see changes.

## Assignment 5 : Answers :

1. `docker build -t cmatrix .`
2. `docker container run -it cmatrix sh`

## Assignment 6

> Running startup scripts with ENTRYPOINT

This assignment has you building a Dockerfile from scratch 
to perform startup tasks with an ENTRYPOINT script. 
This script will perform a few actions before starting the FastAPI Python web API server.

### Dockerfile Requirements

- This is a Python app, so you should start with the `python:slim` image. I always prefer slim images
  when available, as the default language images are usually too big and bloated for real-world use.
- Set the working directory to `/app`.
- Python apps often keep their dependencies in a requirements.txt file, so let's copy that in first, 
  so we can install dependencies before we copy all the other files in.
- Install the dependencies with a run command for `pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`
- Now let's copy all files in after requirements are installed.
- This app requires persistant data, so lets create a volume statment for `/app/data`.
- Set the entrypoint to run the startup script `./docker-entrypoint.sh`.
- Set the cmd to start the uvicorn web server with `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`.

### Testing the Image

- Once this image builds, you can run it with a `-p 8000:8000` to make the web server available on http://localhost:8000
- The most interesting URL for testing is the built-in docs of FastAPI at http://localhost:8000/docs
- Python pip has a `--no-cache-dir` option to avoid caching the package index locally, so a command would look like `pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`.
- Checkout the `docker-entrypoint.sh` script for the startup tasks. It's a simple script that checks several common things like ensuring the `/app/data` directory exists and copying over any initial data files (which you might want to peak at, ðŸ˜Ž).
